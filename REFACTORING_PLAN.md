# DEPRECATED - OLD APPROACH

This plan has been superseded by PROPER_REFACTORING_PLAN.md

The approach in this file was fundamentally flawed:
- Wrong terminology ("partners" for user's own platforms)
- Architectural patches instead of clean design
- Multiple systems doing the same thing
- Confusing concepts

## What Was Wrong

### 1. **Conceptual Problems**
- User being their own "partner" is weird
- "Partner management" for your own platforms makes no sense
- Mixed up platforms with people

### 2. **Technical Debt**
- Three different storage systems
- Dual code paths everywhere
- Try/catch blocks as architecture
- No clear data model

### 3. **User Experience Issues**
- Confusing terminology
- Complex configuration flows
- Unclear what partners vs platforms mean

## Correct Approach

See **PROPER_REFACTORING_PLAN.md** for the clean architecture that should be implemented:

- **Recipients** (not partners) - destinations for tasks
- **User Platforms** - platforms you own and manage
- **Shared Recipients** - platforms others shared with you
- Clean separation of concerns
- Single storage system
- Clear terminology
- Proper foreign keys

The old "partner" approach was architectural debt that needed fundamental rethinking, not more patches.
