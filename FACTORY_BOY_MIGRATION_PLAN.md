# FACTORY BOY MIGRATION PLAN

> **⚠️ CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT ⚠️**  
> **BEFORE starting ANY task, ALWAYS:**
> 1. **Read existing test files** to understand current patterns
> 2. **Read existing MD files** to understand established approaches  
> 3. **Check for Factory Boy usage** before reverting to mocks
> 4. **Follow established architectural decisions**

## 🎯 **DISCOVERY ANALYSIS**

### **Current State Assessment:**
**✅ Factory Boy is installed** (`environment.yml` line 37: `factory-boy`)  
**❌ Factory Boy is NOT being used** (no imports found in tests)  
**⚠️ Mixed Testing Patterns:**
- `conftest.py` - Mock-based repositories and services
- Unit tests - Mix of mocks and manual object creation  
- Integration tests - Real container usage

### **The Problem:**
I incorrectly added **mock-based tests** in `test_workflow_fixes.py` when:
1. Factory Boy is available and should be used
2. The codebase has moved away from mocks for better testing
3. Real database interactions would have caught the corruption bug
4. Factory Boy provides better test data consistency

## 📋 MIGRATION PLAN

### 🚀 CURRENT STATUS
**Currently Working On:** Factory Boy Implementation Plan  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-04  
**Next Priority:** Create Factory Boy infrastructure

**✅ COMPLETED:** 
- ✅ Analysis of current testing patterns
- ✅ Confirmed Factory Boy availability but non-usage
- ✅ Identified mock-based test problems

**🚧 IN PROGRESS:**
- Creating Factory Boy migration plan

**📋 PENDING:**
- Implement Factory Boy factories
- Migrate workflow tests from mocks to factories
- Update MD template with analysis requirements

## 🔥 SECTION 1: HIGH PRIORITY - Factory Boy Infrastructure

### Overview
Create comprehensive Factory Boy factories for all test objects to replace mock-based testing with real object testing.

### 📊 Current Testing Analysis
```bash
# Current test patterns found:
echo "=== Mock-based (conftest.py) ==="
grep -n "Mock" tests/conftest.py

echo "=== Factory Boy imports ==="
grep -r "import factory" tests/ || echo "NONE FOUND"

echo "=== Integration test patterns ==="
grep -n "container\|real" tests/integration/*.py
```

### Root Cause Analysis
```
# PROBLEM: Using mocks instead of Factory Boy for test data generation
# IMPACT: Tests don't catch real database/service integration issues  
# CAUSE: Factory Boy installed but infrastructure not implemented
```

### Detailed Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **1.1 Create Factory Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Create `tests/factories/` directory structure
  - [ ] Implement `UnifiedRecipientFactory`
  - [ ] Implement `TaskFactory` 
  - [ ] Implement `UserPreferencesFactory`
  
- [ ] **1.2 Database Integration**  
  - [ ] Setup test database with transactions
  - [ ] Implement factory database sequences
  - [ ] Add rollback mechanisms for test isolation
  
- [ ] **1.3 Service Integration**
  - [ ] Create factory-based service fixtures
  - [ ] Replace mock repositories with real ones + factories
  - [ ] Ensure proper dependency injection in tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All test objects created via Factory Boy factories
- [ ] No more `Mock()` objects for core domain models
- [ ] Real database transactions in tests (with rollback)
- [ ] Test data consistency across all test files

## 🔥 SECTION 2: HIGH PRIORITY - Workflow Tests Migration

### Overview
Migrate the mock-based workflow tests to use Factory Boy and real database interactions.

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **2.1 Replace Mock Objects**
  - [ ] Replace `Mock()` repositories with real ones
  - [ ] Use `RecipientFactory` for test recipients
  - [ ] Use `TaskFactory` for test tasks
  - [ ] Use real service instances with test database
  
- [ ] **2.2 Database Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Test actual `is_personal` field database storage
  - [ ] Test actual recipient creation workflows
  - [ ] Verify database state matches expected logic
  
- [ ] **2.3 Screenshot Attachment Tests**
  - [ ] Test real file creation and cleanup
  - [ ] Test actual platform attachment calls
  - [ ] Use temp directory fixtures for file testing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Tests would catch database corruption issues
- [ ] Tests use real objects, not mocks
- [ ] Tests verify actual database state
- [ ] Screenshot tests work with real temp files

## 🔥 SECTION 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY - MD Template Updates

### Overview
Update MD planning templates to require analysis before starting tasks.

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **3.1 Update PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md**
  - [ ] Add mandatory analysis section
  - [ ] Require reading existing tests/MDs first
  - [ ] Add Factory Boy usage verification
  
- [ ] **3.2 Update BEST_PRACTICES.md**
  - [ ] Add "No Mock Reversion" rule
  - [ ] Document Factory Boy requirements
  - [ ] Add analysis requirements

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All future tasks require upfront analysis
- [ ] Template prevents mock reversion mistakes
- [ ] Clear Factory Boy usage guidelines

## 📊 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION

### **Factory Infrastructure Files:**
```
tests/
├── factories/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── recipient_factory.py      # UnifiedRecipient factories
│   ├── task_factory.py          # Task factories  
│   ├── preferences_factory.py   # UserPreferences factories
│   └── base.py                  # Base factory configuration
├── conftest.py                  # Updated with Factory Boy fixtures
└── unit/
    └── test_workflow_fixes.py   # Migrated from mocks to factories
```

### **Example Factory Structure:**
```python
# tests/factories/recipient_factory.py
import factory
from models.unified_recipient import UnifiedRecipient

class UnifiedRecipientFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = UnifiedRecipient
    
    id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: n)
    user_id = 123
    name = factory.Faker('company')
    platform_type = 'todoist'
    credentials = factory.Faker('password')
    is_personal = True
    enabled = True

class SharedRecipientFactory(UnifiedRecipientFactory):
    is_personal = False
    name = factory.Faker('company', suffix=' (Shared)')
```
