### **3. Timezone Conversion Bug**
**‚ùå Problem:** Portugal time (UTC+1) not properly converted to UTC  
**‚úÖ Solution:** Enhanced parsing service with comprehensive timezone handling

**Issue Description:**
- User in Cascais, Portugal (UTC+1) reported incorrect scheduling
- Task at "12:00 local time" was scheduled at "12:00 UTC" instead of "11:00 UTC"
- Bot wasn't converting local time to UTC properly

**Fix Implementation:**
```python
# Enhanced timezone mapping in parsing_service.py
timezone_map = {
    'portugal': 'UTC+1 (UTC+2 during DST)',
    'cascais': 'UTC+1 (UTC+2 during DST)',
    'lisbon': 'UTC+1 (UTC+2 during DST)',
    # ... other locations
}

# Clear instructions to LLM in prompt template
IMPORTANT TIMEZONE HANDLING:
- The user is located in: {location}
- When a time is mentioned (like "12:00"), interpret it as LOCAL TIME
- Convert local time to UTC for the due_time field
- For Portugal/Cascais: Local time is UTC+1 (or UTC+2 during DST)
- Example: User says "12:00" ‚Üí UTC time should be "11:00"
```

## üîÑ **Deployment Status:**

**‚úÖ Bot Redeployed** - All fixes active in Docker container with timezone handling
**‚úÖ Database Intact** - Existing tasks preserved  
**‚úÖ Enhanced UX** - All new features working including proper timezone conversion

**‚úÖ Production Ready** - Complete user experience with accurate scheduling

### **4. Missing Button Handlers**
**‚ùå Problem:** "Change Platform" and "Settings" buttons did nothing when clicked  
**‚úÖ Solution:** Added missing callback handlers for interactive UI

**Issues Fixed:**
- "Change Platform" button in Settings had no handler
- "Settings" button in Main Menu had no handler  
- Clicking buttons resulted in no response

**Handlers Added:**
```python
@router.callback_query(lambda c: c.data == "change_platform")
@router.callback_query(lambda c: c.data == "show_settings")
```

### **5. Updated Trello Setup Instructions**
**‚ùå Problem:** Trello setup instructions pointed to outdated developer portal  
**‚úÖ Solution:** Updated instructions for current Trello Power-Up Admin Portal

**Updated Instructions:**
1. Go to https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
2. Create Power-Up ‚Üí API Key tab ‚Üí Generate Token
3. Format: `API_KEY:TOKEN`

The bot now provides complete visibility into task scheduling, accurate platform setup instructions, proper timezone conversion, working interactive buttons, and current Trello setup process! üéâ
